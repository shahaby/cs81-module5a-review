# Reflection on Hobby Tracking Program

## What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?

Reading the code and writing comments taught me how to make sense of code written by someone else and come up with meaningful comments that would help others. I also gained a deeper understanding of higher-order functions in JavaScript and their usage, specifically .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().

## What was the most confusing part?

Wrapping my head around arrow functions is still the most confusing part especially when comparing JavaScripts syntax to other programming languages but with practice and patience it's slowly becoming second nature.
